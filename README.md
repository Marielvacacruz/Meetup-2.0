# Meetup 2.0 Project

## **Welcome**
Meetup 2.0 is an application modeled after the [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/) site.

The site is intended for building community by joining groups with common interests.


***Explore the clone here: [Meetup2.0](https://meetup-2point0.herokuapp.com/) !***

As a guest you can check out some of the groups that are currently listed, but if you'd

like to create your own you'll have to  [Sign-up](https://meetup-2point0.herokuapp.com/signup) first OR if you already have an account you can [Login](https://meetup-2point0.herokuapp.com/login).

***Demo User***
    : The login form gives you the ability to use a demo user login details to explore the app a little more

        - Explore groups
        - Use the DEMO USER login

        - Delete groups you created

## Membership
    A logged in user can:
        - Join a group (status will be pending but group will be added to 'my groups')
        - View members with non pending status in each group by clicking on individual groups
        - Leave a group (this will delete the users membership)
